## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apcaballes87/cake-genie.git
cd cake-genie
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Configuration

1. Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a storage bucket named `uploadopenai`
3. Create a table named `uploadpricing2` with the following columns:
   - `id` (int8, primary key, auto-increment)
   - `photo` (text) - for storing image URLs
   - `filename` (text) - for storing original filenames
   - `uploaded_at` (timestamptz) - for tracking upload time
   - `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())

4. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 3. Database Schema

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create the uploadpricing2 table
CREATE TABLE uploadpricing2 (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  photo TEXT NOT NULL,
  filename TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (optional but recommended)
ALTER TABLE uploadpricing2 ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy to allow inserts (adjust as needed for your use case)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public inserts" ON uploadpricing2
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 4. Storage Setup

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket named `uploadopenai`
3. Set it to public if you want direct access to images
4. Configure upload policies as needed

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
